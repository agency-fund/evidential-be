# Airplane Mode âœˆ

"Airplane Mode" allows the frontend and backend to start up without relying on any internet resources. This allows
development when disconnected from the internet.

When in airplane mode:

- The backend Admin API calls and the frontend will authenticate you as testing@agency.fund. You cannot develop on
  login/logout features when airplane mode is enabled.
- testing@agency.fund will have an organization and participant type created automatically.
- The frontend may emit some errors about fonts being unavailable (these can be ignored).
- Unit tests will fail in airplane mode.

> Note: For airplane mode to work, the frontend and backend must both have been started in their non-airplane mode
> while connected to the internet.

To start the frontend in airplane mode, run:

```shell
task start-airplane
```

To start the backend in airplane mode, run:

```shell
task start-airplane
```

To run the backend tests in airplane mode, run:

```shell
task test-airplane
```
